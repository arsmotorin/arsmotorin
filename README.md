### Hi

I'm 16 and I'm from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

I'm starting to learn JavaScript and by way of second programming language will be Java. I work technical support in the most popular hosting in the CIS - [Hosting-Minecraft.pro](https://hosting-minecraft.pro).

Also, I have a small Minecraft server with a vanilla + role-play theme - [Frogdream](https://frogdream.xyz).
